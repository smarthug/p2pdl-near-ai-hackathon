# P2PDL-NEAR-AI-Hackathon
P2PDL (Peer-to-peer decentralized learning) is the first decentralized peer-to-peer learning protocol with an incentive mechanism. Anyone can host end users to construct a machine learning model without compromising their privacy and security. Also, the learning process is transparently recorded on the Near blockchain, facilitating a fair incentive distribution.
